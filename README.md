# **Practical Assessment**
## **Lou Geh Manufacturing Company**
Lou Geh manufacturing company produces products. The following product informationis stored: product name, product ID and quantity on hand. These products are madeup of many components. Each component can be supplied by one or more suppliers. Thefollowing component information is kept: component ID, name, description, suppliers who supply them, and products in which they are used.

- A supplier can exist without providing components.
- A component does not have to be associated with a supplier.
- A component does not have to be associated with a product. Not all components are usedin products.
- A product cannot exist without components.


## **Task**
1. Create a prototype based on the attached problem
2. Technologies and design to be used are the following:
    * Backend approach - REST -API
    * API Backend -  NodeJS
    * Database - MySQL
    * Frontend - Basic HTML, CSS and Javascript
3. As for your application documentations you need to provide the ff:
   1. ERD
   2. DFD
4. Provide a ```README.md``` containing the setup guide.
5. The application should be published in Github via forked repository and for final version of your prototype you will need to create a ```Pull request``` in Github .
6. You will send the Github link to us thru our email devops@biotechfarms.com on or before ```September 18 2023```.
7. Actual assessment interview will be conducted on ```September 19 2023 @ 2:00 PM```.

    ### **Submission format**
    - Repository should show codebase directory directly **DO NOT PUT YOUR CODE BASE IN A ZIP FILE** use git commands instead to push your code-base and further updates.
    - Prototype's latest version should be the default branch of the repository.
    - Provide a READ.ME file on how to install and deploy your prototype, and its prerequisite, software, sdk(if needed), and driver.
